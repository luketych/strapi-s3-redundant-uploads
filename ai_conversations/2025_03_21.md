## Task
Help fix code for a custom upload file extension in Strapi to intercept the response and customize it by adding "hello":"world" to it. Later, add Short.io integration to create short URLs for uploaded files.

## Analysis
The project had multiple issues that needed to be fixed:

1. Multiple implementations of the upload controller in different locations, causing conflicts:
   - src/extensions/controllers/upload.js
   - src/extensions/upload/controllers/upload.js
   - src/extensions/upload/strapi-server.js

2. The custom route at `/api/upload` was conflicting with the default upload routes.

3. The content-api controller was missing required methods that were expected by the routes configuration.

4. The plugin structure was different than expected, causing TypeScript errors.

5. Node.js version compatibility issues with SQLite bindings.

## Solution
After trying several approaches, we found that using Strapi's lifecycle hooks was the most robust solution:

1. Used Strapi's database lifecycle hooks to intercept and modify file responses at the database level.
2. Added hooks for all relevant file operations (create, find, findOne, update).
3. Each hook adds the "hello":"world" field to the response.
4. Added Short.io integration to create short URLs for uploaded files.
5. Fixed Node.js version compatibility issues by using the correct version specified in .nvmrc.
6. Removed unnecessary files and configurations that might be causing conflicts.

## Changes Made
1. Completely rewrote `src/extensions/upload/strapi-server.js` to:
   - Use Strapi's lifecycle hooks instead of modifying controllers directly
   - Add hooks for afterCreate, afterFindMany, afterFindOne, and afterUpdate events
   - Add the "hello":"world" field to all file responses
   - Integrate with Short.io to create short URLs for uploaded files
   - Provide detailed logging for debugging

2. Created `scripts/shortio_script.js` with:
   - Function to create short URLs using the Short.io API
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Environment variable configuration for API key and domain

3. Marked `src/extensions/controllers/upload.js` and `src/extensions/upload/controllers/upload.js` as deprecated.

4. Removed `src/extensions/upload/routes/custom-upload.js` and the empty routes directory to prevent conflicts.

5. Enhanced `src/extensions/upload/middlewares/upload-middleware.js` to better log upload requests.

6. Fixed Node.js version compatibility issues by switching to the correct version and rebuilding dependencies.

## How to Test
1. Start the Strapi server
2. Upload a file through the admin interface or via the API
3. Check the response to verify that "hello":"world" has been added to each file object
4. Check that a short URL has been created and added to the response as "shortUrl"
5. Check the server logs to see the lifecycle hooks and Short.io integration in action with messages like:
   ```
   üîÑ Lifecycle hook: afterCreate
   ‚úÖ Added hello:world to file: 43
   üìÅ Detected new file upload: https://example.com/file.jpg
   Short link created: https://short.io/abc123
   ```
