# Intent
- Factor out file verification and redundant copy creation logic from strapi-server.js into a separate module to improve code organization and maintainability

# Implementation
- Created new fileVerification.js module with extracted functions:
  - calculateHash
  - downloadFile  
  - verifyAndCreateRedundantCopy
- Removed browser-specific APIs (FormData, Blob) that aren't available in Node.js
- Updated strapi-server.js to import and use the new module
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving code structure

# Known Issues/Notes
- The redundant copy creation still uses the original event.params.data rather than the downloaded file buffer
- Code assumes global strapi object is available in fileVerification.js module
