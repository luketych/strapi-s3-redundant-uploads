# Conversation History

## Task
Make a new endpoint for api/atom, that will accept json with only an id

## Changes Made

### Intent
- Create a new API endpoint that accepts POST requests with a JSON body containing only an ID field
- Keep the endpoint simple and focused on a single responsibility

### Implementation
1. Created controller (src/api/atom/controllers/atom.js):
   - Added `create` method to handle POST requests
   - Implemented input validation for required ID field
   - Returns the received ID or an error message

2. Created routes (src/api/atom/routes/atom.js):
   - Defined POST route at /api/atom
   - Connected route to controller's create method
   - Set up basic configuration with no specific policies or middlewares

### Known Considerations
- No additional validation beyond checking if ID exists
- Response is simple object with received ID
- No persistent storage of the ID implemented
