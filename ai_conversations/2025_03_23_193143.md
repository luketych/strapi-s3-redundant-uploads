# Conversation History

## Task
Make a new endpoint for api/atom, that will accept json with only an id

## Changes Made

### Intent
- Create a new API endpoint that accepts POST requests with a JSON body containing only an ID field
- Follow Strapi's convention for route and controller structure
- Implement proper error handling and logging for debugging

### Implementation
1. Created content type (src/api/atom/content-types/atom/schema.json):
   - Defined `atomId` as required string field
   - Disabled draft/publish functionality

2. Created controller (src/api/atom/controllers/atom.js):
   - Implemented `create` method with comprehensive logging
   - Added validation for required ID field
   - Uses Strapi's entityService for data persistence
   - Includes detailed error reporting

3. Created route (src/api/atom/routes/atom.js):
   - Defined POST route at /api/atom
   - Connected to controller's create method
   - Configured with no specific policies or middlewares

### Known Considerations
- Route only accepts POST method
- Validates ID presence but no additional validation
- Added extensive logging for debugging purposes
- Uses Strapi's built-in error handling
